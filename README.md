# PokeCards
PokeCards is a simple web app built with HTML, Sass, and JavaScript that allows you to select how many Pokemon you want to view and displays a card with information about the selected Pokemon.

## Getting Started
To use the PokeCards app, simply visit the following URL in your web browser:

https://pokecards.com/

Once the page loads, you'll see a select list that allows you to choose how many Pokemon you want to view. After selecting the desired number of Pokemon, you can choose one from the select list, and a card will appear with information about that Pokemon.

The card displays the Pokemon's name, type, ability, hidden ability, and a list of stats.

## Technical Details
PokeCards uses the Pokemon API to fetch data about the Pokemon. When you select a Pokemon from the list, the app makes a request to the API and retrieves information about the selected Pokemon.

The app is built using HTML, Sass, and JavaScript. The styling is done with Sass, which is compiled into CSS using a preprocessor. The JavaScript is responsible for fetching data from the API, updating the UI with the selected Pokemon's information, and handling user interactions.
